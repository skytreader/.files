# Create and Manage User Profile in Firefox

This should be easy, and seems to be so with Windows ~~but so far I haven't
found a GUI-way to do this in Ubuntu~~. Anyway, to create a new profile invoke
Firefox like so from terminal

    firefox -no-remote -P

Then, after creating a new profile, you can use it by invoking Firefox as

    firefox -no-remote -P "Profile name"

**NOTE:** All this can be achieved without a terminal by visiting
`about: profiles` in your browser window.
