# Create and Manage User Profile in Firefox

This should be easy, and seems to be so with Windows but so far I haven't found
a GUI-way to do this in Ubuntu. Anyway, to create a new profile invoke Firefox
like so from terminal

    firefox -no-remote -P

Then, after creating a new profile, you can use it by invoking Firefox as

    firefox -no-remote -P "Profile name"
