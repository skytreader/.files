Can live without these but just noting here in case I need them in the future.

- [pdftk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/) - No Ubuntu package yet.
It is compilable from source though.
- [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) - No official Ubuntu package yet but see
[this issue](https://github.com/github/hub/issues/718) for more details
(`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cpick/hub; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install hub`)
- [nethogs](https://github.com/raboof/nethogs) - Very useful for debugging shitty
internet connections and such. Has an Ubuntu package too. Not included in setup
for minimalism.
